# Pranay Singh, aspiring coder
## My Previous Experience
* My first experience with coding was taking APCSP in my sophmore year of high school, which was a great introduction with basic concepts like block coding and learning about creating user interfaces in MIT app developer. This was my introduction to the coding world, and it left me curious to learn and create more. Beacuse of this new found curiosity, I decided to take IOS App Development this year, which is my junior year of high school. 
## My Apps
### [Grocery List](https://github.com/PranaySingh04/GroceryList/tree/main)
* My first app in this class was the Grocery List app, which I made to learn the basics of Swift and SwiftUI.
* This app functions as a grocery list, letting you add items to it, and clear the list after you are done.
* If I was to continue working on this app, I would have a lot of things to add, like an improved ui, making your data persistent so that if you close out of the app, your list stays there when you reopen it, and the ability to have multiple lists at the same time.
### Tower Defense Game
* Currently working on a Tower Defense game along with a few people in 4th hour.

## GitHub
* First time using GitHub, learned the functions and uses of it
* I learned how to create a repository and what its uses are
* I learned how to push and pull files between GitHub and Xcode 
## Swift/Xcode
* This is my first time using Swift or Xcode, so I am still learning some of the basic funtions.
* Learned basic swift syntax using CodeWithChris tutorials and created some beginner apps.
### [CodeWithChris](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithChris/videos) tutorials
* The first app I made using tutorials was the [War Card game](), which served as a pretty good introduction to SwiftUI. 
## Sketch
* Created an app icon for the first time, which could be used for a space game. 
* Learned how use editing tools to make an icon look more appealing.

# Pranay Singh, aspiring coder
## My Previous Experience
* My first experience with coding was taking APCSP in my sophmore year of high school, which was a great introduction with basic concepts like block coding and learning about creating user interfaces in MIT app developer. This was my introduction to the coding world, and it left me curious to learn and create more. Beacuse of this new found curiosity, I decided to take IOS App Development this year, which is my junior year of high school. 
### APCSP Create Project
* The first real independant app I made last year was for my create project at the end of the class.
* My app was a fitness check app, the main function was to see if the user was healthy, and it would give health advice that was unique to each user. 
* [Code for my app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1p63aB9sUG9sxqUp9bvRLz0oVD8ch_GrwGw7GAGzH1io/edit?usp=sharing)
* [Written summary of my app](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fgVzvcrEFoP4Dtl84nQLB18BENNpiSHjT4IuV_bA6-w/edit?usp=sharing)
## Current Apps/Projects
### [Grocery List](https://github.com/PranaySingh04/GroceryList/tree/main)
* My first app in this class was the Grocery List app, which I made to learn the basics of Swift and SwiftUI.
* This app functions as a grocery list, letting you add items to it, and clear the list after you are done.
* If I was to continue working on this app, I would have a lot of things to add, like an improved ui, making your data persistent so that if you close out of the app, your list stays there when you reopen it, and the ability to have multiple lists at the same time.
### [Tower Defense Game](https://github.com/EPHS-iOS/Tower-Defense)
* This is an app that I was a part of early on, but eventually stopped working on it as I was spending more time working on other projects.
### [OpenVote](https://github.com/BillA-Dev/OpenVote)
* OpenVote is a campaign finance app that allows you to easily view the campaign spending of US politicians. The purpose of this app is to bring awareness to the campaign spending issue in America, and have an easy way to show people exactly how much money their representatives are spending.
* I created the App Store page and App Store videos/animations for OpenVote using hotpot.io and Adobe Premiere Rush.
* OpenVote has been accepted by the App Store on the first submission attempt!
## GitHub
* This was my first time using GitHub, I learned the functions and uses of it.
* I learned how to create a repository and what its uses are.
* I learned how to push and pull files between GitHub and Xcode.
* I learned how to create quality READMEs, that are easy to read and navigate. 
## Swift/Xcode
* This is my first time using Swift or Xcode, so I am still learning some of the basic funtions.
* Learned basic swift syntax using CodeWithChris tutorials and created some beginner apps.
### [CodeWithChris](https://www.youtube.com/c/CodeWithChris/videos) tutorials
* The first app I made using tutorials was the [War Card game](), which served as a pretty good introduction to SwiftUI. 
## Sketch
* Learned what an app icon should consist of, and attempted to create a few.
* Created multiple app icons for the first time, which could be used for different apps and games. 
* Learned how use editing tools to make an icon look appealing.
### Some icons I have made

## Adobe Premiere Rush
* Adobe Premiere Rush is the editing software I used to create the app store videos for OpenVote. 
* This is the first time I have used an advanced editing software, and I learned a lot about the basics of video editing and app store videos.
## IOS App Development Course reflection
* I decided to take the IOS App Development class at EPHS because I was interested in programming, but I didn't want to take an another AP class like AP Java. I thought that this app would mostly just be learning more about programming, but in this class I have experienced and learned so much more about the process of creating an app. I have learned about every step of getting an app into the app store, which is surprisingly long with lots of different components. I learned about creating GitHub repositories, creating app icons and app pages to effectively advertise apps. This was also the first time I have used Xcode, so I learned about boht the backend and front end of creating apps, working on both coding and ui design. Overall this was a great class to take and I learned a lot of very useful skills in the process of creating an app.
